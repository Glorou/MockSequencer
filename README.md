This is demo implementenation code of my [ImSequencer](https://github.com/Glorou/ImSequencer) library.
Its a work in progress but it should outline program flow.

What currently isnt properly implemented in the demo is the compact sequence ticks, but they do work provided your
CustomDrawCompact has the correct math (featured in CustomDraw), the curve editor also needs some better sorting, but
all of these work properly in the library itself, and are solely a implementation issue on my end.
